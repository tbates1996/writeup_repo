I think that the project as a whole was great; however, it can be improved by teaching us a little more about how to preform exploits outside of what is covered in class. I feel that we learn about the vunerabilies, but it would be nice to see more examples of how it's done in practice. Our favorite part of the project was using the SESSION\_ID cookies to do a SQL Injection to gain access to dirks account. It helped show how dangerous SQL injection attacks could be. In addition to that I was interesting to see how you could take this information and try to find exploits on actual website without having the source code.
